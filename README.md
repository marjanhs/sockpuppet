We  explore  the  problem  of  sockpuppet  detection in deceptive opinion spam using authorship attribution and verification approaches. Two methods are explored. The first is a feature subsam-pling scheme that uses the KL-Divergence on stylistic language models of an author to find discriminative features. The second is a transduction scheme, spy induction that leverages the diversity of authors in theunlabeled test set by sending a set of spies (positive samples) from train-ing set to retrieve hidden samples in the unlabeled test set using nearest and farthest neighbors. Experiments using ground truth sockpuppet data show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes
